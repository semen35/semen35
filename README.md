## 🚀 About me:
 #### 🎓 I completed courses _"Quality Assurance Engineer", "Basic Web and SQL for Software Testing"_. Very good knowledge and little experience with _"HTML"_, _"CSS"_ and _"SQL"_. I have experience writing _"Test Сases"_ and _"Сhecklists"_.I quickly find a common language with colleagues, show leadership qualities and initiative.📈At my previous job, I repeatedly found errors in the software.
